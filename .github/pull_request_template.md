<!---
Thank you for submitting a PR to the rust rpm implementation!

Commits should be distinct and have a clear purpose, with messages
which explain to the reviewer WHAT changed, and WHY it had to change
and how the WHAT and the WHY tie together.

At the bottom of your commit messages, add a line "Closes #IssueNumber)"
for any issues resolved by the commit, substituting in an actual issue number.
This will automatically close the issue once the PR is merged and creates a
cross reference.

If things are still WIP or feedback on particular impl details
are wanted, state them here or leave comments below.
